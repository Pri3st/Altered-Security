- The goal in this CTF is to gather information from the previously compromised Tenants.
- The information can be gathered from Azure Resources named ESCROW.
- The final gaol is to find a pair of valid Azure credentials for a User Identity to authenticate to the **DefCorpVault** Tenant and capture the final flag.
- 3 of the compromised Tenants contain hashes which can be used to build the password.
- 1 Tenant contains the User Identity UPN.
- If 1 of the above Tenants is unreachable, contact support to get the needed information from them.
