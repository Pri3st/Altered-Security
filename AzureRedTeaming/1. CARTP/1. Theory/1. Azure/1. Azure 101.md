## Azure terminology
- **Region:** A set of Azure datacenters that deploy inside a latency-defined perimeter. The datacenters connect through a dedicated, regional, low-latency network. Most Azure resources run in a specific Azure region.
- **Microsoft Entra ID:** The Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service (directory services in the cloud but with enhanced capabilities compared to Active Directory). Microsoft Entra ID lets employees sign in and access resources. Entra ID is a management platform from the cloud (reset passwords, create users, add users to groups, etc.) and used as the authentication piece into Azure as a whole (as well as O365).
- **Enterprise**: This represents the Azure global account. It’s the unique identity that the business owns and allows access to subscriptions, tenants, and services.
- **Tenant**: Tenants are instances of Azure for the Enterprise. An Enterprise can have multiple tenants. This is often seen in companies that are geographically separated or subsidiaries. Access to one tenant in an enterprise does _not_ give access to another tenant. An analogy is that tenants are similar to Forests in Active Directory, where trusts can be established (within Azure AD), but that is not default and must be configured.
- **Management groups:** Logical containers that you use for one or more subscriptions. You can define a hierarchy of management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance through inheritance.
- **Subscriptions**: Subscriptions are logical containers that represent how you gain access to Azure services (Azure itself, Azure AD, Storage, etc). Subscriptions are often broken out into uses for the businesses, e.g. a subscription for production web apps, another subscription for development web apps, etc. It serves as a logical container for your resources. Each Azure resource is associated with _only one_ subscription.
- **Resource Groups**: Resource groups are logical containers that house the resources. Business will often have multiple resource groups depending on their usage of the resource as they're commonly used to represent a collection of assets that are required to support a workload, application, or specific function within a subscription.
- **Resources**: Resources are the specific application, such as SQL servers, SQL DBs, virtual networks, run-books, accounts, etc that's managed by Azure.
- **Runbooks**: Runbooks are part of the Azure Automation service and support scripting languages PowerShell and Python (2.7). These allow for automation of operations within Azure, e.g. start-up of multiple virtual machines at once. By default, only signed script can be run on a VM. Runbooks can run in Azure Sandbox or a Hybrid Runbook Worker.
- **Azure AD Connect**: Azure AD connect is the tools that actually connects on-premise with Azure AD. It has features such as hash synchronization and federation (between Tenants) to link to on-premise AD.
- **Service Principal**: An Azure service principal is a security identity used by user-created apps, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a ‘user identity’ (login and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions to access your resources. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you only grant it the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. For example, an organization can assign its deployment scripts to run authenticated as a service principal. A service principal can be one of three types: application, managed identity, and legacy. It essentially is an ID of an application that needs to access Azure resources. It is **not limited to Azure resources and can be used to authenticate and access various Microsoft services**.
- **Managed Identity**: Managed identities are a feature in Azure that provides an identity for a service or resource **only within the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant**. They are designed to simplify the management of credentials used by applications and services running in Azure. They are typically used when you have a resource (such as an Azure Virtual Machine or Azure Function) that needs to authenticate and access other Azure resources securely. Instead of managing credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) manually, you can use a managed identity. When you enable a managed identity for an Azure resource, Azure creates a service principal in the Azure AD tenant that represents that resource. This service principal is used to authenticate the resource with Azure AD, and it has specific permissions associated with it. Managed identities are a specific type of identity designed for Azure resources, making it easier to manage authentication and access to Azure services securely. There are two types of managed identities:
	- System assigned: The identity is linked to a single Azure Resource, e.g a Virtual Machine or a Web App. They “live” with the Azure Resource, which means they get deleted when the Azure resource gets deleted.
	- User Assigned Managed Identity: You first have to create it as a stand-alone Azure resource by itself, after which it can be linked to multiple Azure Resources.
- **Security Principal**: A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that is requesting access to Azure resources.
- **RBAC**: Azure role based access controls (Azure RBAC) helps us to manage who has the access to the Azure resources and what actions they can perform on the resources and what area they have access to. There are basically 3 important elements in Azure RBAC:
	- Security Principal
	- Role Definition (essentially a collection of permissions - it lists the actions that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete)
	- Scope (set of resources that the access applies to)
- **ABAC**: Azure ABAC builds on Azure RBAC by adding role assignment conditions based on attributes in the context of specific actions. It is an authorization system that can help us to have more fined grained access control define based on the attributes associated with security principals, resources, and environment. The condition can filter down the permission granted as a part of the role definition and role assignments. Attributes that have specific business meaning are usually used to implement ABAC.
- **App Registration**: When creating an application registration you establish a trust relationship between the Microsoft's identity platform and your custom application, meaning you trust Microsoft, but Microsoft does not trust your application in the same way. You can create single-tenant (only principals in the “home” tenant can authenticate), multi-tenant (users and applications in other Azure AD tenants to access your app.), and Microsoft (liveid - you can allow Microsoft Live ID accounts to access your application) based app registrations or a combination of them. But the application definition is only tied to its home directory.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Enterprise application is the application identity within your directory (Entra ID). The service principal (enterprise app) can only be assigned access to the directory it exists, and **act as an instance of the application**. Enterprise applications (the service principal) have a reference to its Application registration. In most cases, you have one app registration and the service principal (enterprise application) in the same tenant.  When the application is accessible by multiple tenants, all tenants will have one enterprise application. However, the application registration itself will be in its home tenant. If you look in the enterprise application blade you can find applications from other app vendors being used by you or other users in your directory. Azure application registrations are the global representation of your custom application, and Enterprise Application is the local representation of the same application, bound to your tenant. An application password can be used to login to a tenant as a service principal. MFA is usually not applied on a service principal!
- **App Services**: Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and [Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview#app-service-on-linux)-based environments. App Service adds security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management to the deployed applications. Additionally, one can take advantage of Azure's DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.
- **Function Apps**: Function Apps (or Azure Functions) is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running. Code execution usually depends on a trigger, e.g HTTPTrigger.
- **Logic Apps**: Azure Logic Apps is a cloud platform where you can create and run automated workflows with little to no code. By using the visual designer and selecting from prebuilt operations, you can quickly build a workflow that integrates and manages your apps, data, services, and systems. Azure Logic Apps simplifies the way that you connect legacy, modern, and cutting-edge systems across cloud, on premises, and hybrid environments.
- **Automation Account**: Azure's automation service that allows to automate tasks for Azure resources, on-prem, infra and other cloud providers using using Runbooks, Configuration Management (supports DSC), update management and shared resources (credentials, certificates, connections etc.) for both Windows and Linux resources hosted on Azure and on-prem. Some common scenarios for automation as per Microsoft:
	- Deploy VMs across a hybrid environment using run books.
	- Identify configuration changes
	- Configure VMs
	- Retrieve Inventory
- **Hybrid Runbook Worker**: They are used when a Runbook is to be run on a non-Azure machine. A user-defined hybrid runbook worker is a member of hybrid runbook worker group. The Log Analytics Agent is deployed on the VM to register it as a hybrid worker. The hybrid worker jobs run as `SYSTEM` on Windows and `nxautomationaccount` on Linux.
- **Azure Function**: Azure Functions is a serverless concept of cloud-native design that allows a piece of code to be deployed and executed without needing server infrastructure, web server, or any configurations. In addition, azure functions can be written in multiple languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. Let's say you have to send a birthday email to your customers. You're an ASP.NET web developer. Instead of building a website in ASP.NET and employing and hosting it on IIS just for one feature, you can write an azure function, put your email login in the function, and deploy it on the Azure cloud. The azure functions will directly connect to your data source, get your customers' emails, and send them an email on a scheduled date and time. Azure functions are best suited for smaller apps with events that can work independently of other websites. They support continuous deployment where source code update triggers a deployment to Azure (Azure Repos, GitHub, Bitbucket are supported). Deployment slots are supported so that deployments are first done in slots like staging.
- **Dynamic Group Membership**: You can create attribute-based rules to enable dynamic membership for a group in Microsoft Entra ID, part of Microsoft Entra. Dynamic group membership adds and removes group members automatically using membership rules based on member attributes. No Azure AD roles can be assigned to a Dynamic Group but Azure RBAC roles can be assigned.
- **Application Proxy**: Application Proxy allows access to on-prem web applications after sign-in to Entra ID. It has the following components:
	- Endpoint -This is the external URL that the users browse to access the on-prem application. External users must authenticate to Entra ID
	- Application Proxy Service -This services runs in the cloud and passes the token provided by Entra ID to the on-prem connector
	- Application Proxy Connector -This is an agent that runs on the on-prem infrastructure and acts as a communication agent between the cloud proxy service and on-prem application. It also communicates with the on-prem AD in case of SSO
	- On-prem application -The application that is exposed using application proxy
- **Hybrid Identity**: Today, businesses, and corporations are becoming more and more a mixture of on-premises and cloud applications. Users require access to those applications both on-premises and in the cloud. Managing users both on-premises and in the cloud poses challenging scenarios. Microsoft’s identity solutions span on-premises and cloud-based capabilities. These solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location. We call this **hybrid identity**.
## Microsoft Azure Categories 
- Microsoft Azure is a diverse cloud platform that contains hundreds of **products** (also known as SKUs). These Azure SKUs fall into many categories.  For instance: 
	- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (user-managed, raw resources that can be used to build IT environments)     
	    For example:
	    - Virtual Machines 
	    - Storage 
	    - Networking 
	- Platform-as-a-Service (Microsoft-managed, use-specific, packaged offers designed to be the building blocks of applications)     
	    For example:
	    - Azure SQL – Microsoft managed SQL service without a “server running SQL” that can be used as the database back-end for a new or existing application 
	    - Azure Files – Microsoft managed SMB (CIFS) file share service that behaves just like a Windows file server but without a server to manage 
	- Data Services – resources such as machine learning, analytics, and cognitive services 
	- Software-as-a-Service – fully usable, end-user applications written, hosted, and managed by Microsoft
	    - Office 365 
	    - Dynamics 365
## Microsoft Azure Tenants And Subscriptions 
- At the highest level is an Azure **tenant,** also known as an **account** or **directory** (these terms will be used interchangeably).  An Azure tenant represents an organization in Azure and is uniquely associated with an instance of **Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory/AAD).  An Entra ID tenant is a directory that holds users, devices, groups, and other security principles. An Entra ID tenant is used to manage access to Azure and Microsoft 365 resources. Without an Entra ID tenant, you cannot deploy Azure or Windows 365 resources.
- An Azure tenant is free to create and tenant names must be globally unique (i.e. no one else in the world can use the same name). A new tenant has a TenantName.onmicrosoft.com domain associated with it. The tenant name can be updated to a custom domain name.
- Azure is organized by **management groups** and **subscriptions**.  A management group is a container for subscriptions and other management groups. Management groups are an administrative boundary and are used to organize subscriptions. Settings applied to a management group, such as policies or administrative rights are inherited by all management groups and subscriptions in the parent management group.
- An Azure tenant can contain multiple subscriptions, but a subscription can only exist in one tenant. A subscription is a billing an administrative boundary.  An Azure subscription is created directly from Microsoft or through an Azure reseller. All resources are billed based on usage, or consumption, within a subscription.  The monthly Azure invoice is based on resources deployed and used in a subscription. If you don’t run any resources and therefore have no consumption–-your bill is $0.
- **Subscriptions** come in many flavors, but the easiest way to think about them is an agreement between a customer and Microsoft, where Microsoft agrees to provide services based on the published Service Level Agreement (SLA) and the customer agrees to use and pay for the Azure products under the terms of the subscription. A good comparison is electrical power service in a home.  A homeowner opens an account with the electricity provider (subscription), agrees on a rate for electricity and delivery, uses the electricity during a month, and then pays the bill once the power company bills the customer for the electricity consumed. Subscriptions have **globally unique IDs (GUID)** associated with them.  They also have a friendly name that can have any value, and the friendly name does not have to be unique.  As a matter of fact, it’s possible to have subscriptions with the same friendly name inside of the same tenant.  However, try to assign logical, unique names to each of your subscriptions to make things easier to manage.
## Microsoft Azure Resource Groups & Resources
- Within an Azure subscription are **resource groups (RG)**.  A resource group is a logical groupings of resources with a similar lifecycle in Azure.  Resource groups provide an easy way to organize, view and manage resources in Azure.  For example, if there are two complex, multi-component applications A and B, split them into their own resource group (e.g. RG-A and RG-B) to logically group all the compute, storage, and networking for each application with other related components.    
- Resource groups are not billing units.  It is not possible to view the cost associated to a resource group by looking at an Azure invoice.  However, it is possible to view resources usage by resource group from Azure Cost Management.  Resource groups are for ease of management, resource organization, administrative boundary, and isolation.  There are lots of resources in every Azure deployment so keeping things nice, tidy, and logical is very important.  
- There could be multiple resource groups within a single subscription, but a resource group can only be part of only one subscription.  Resource group names do not have to be globally unique but must be unique within a single subscription.  
- Finally, **resources** are created inside a resource group, inside a subscription, and inside a management group. The Entra ID Tenant is the directory service used to apply access control at any object in the hierarchy.  What are these resources?  It’s everything that does something in Azure.  Examples are virtual machines, virtual networks, disks, network cards, VPN gateways, IP addresses, etc.
## Management levels and hierarchy
![[azure_hierarchy.png]]
- **Management groups** help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions that are applied to the management group.
- **Subscriptions** logically associate user accounts with the resources that they create. Each subscription has limits or quotas on the amount of resources that it can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, and projects.
- **Resource groups** are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.
- **Resources** are instances of services that you can create, such as virtual machines, storage, and SQL databases.

#### Example 1
**Azure account/tenant/directory** 
- **Subscription A** 
    - Resource Group 1 
        - Virtual machine (resource)
            - Compute meter 
        - Premium SSD Managed disk (resource)
            - Storage capacity meter 
    - Resource Group 2 
        - Virtual machine (resource)
            - Compute meter 
        - Standard SSD Managed disk (resource)
            - Storage capacity meter 
            - Storage operations meter 
- **Subscription B** 
    - Resource Group 1 
        - Virtual machine (resource)
            - Compute meter 
        - Virtual Network Interface (resource)
            - No billing meter
    - Resource Group 2 
        - Azure SQL (resource)
            - vCPU meter OR 
            - DTU meter 
        - VPN Gateway (resource)
            - VPN gateway
            - Transfer meter
#### Example 2

## Integrating on-premises AD with Azure
#### Password Hash Synchronization
- With Password Hash Synchronization (PHS), the passwords from on-premise AD are actually sent to the cloud, similar to how domain controllers synchronize passwords between each other via replication. This is done from a service account that is created with the installation of AD Connect. If the synchronization account is compromised, it has enough privileges that it potentially could lead to the compromise of the on-premise AD forest, as that account is granted replication rights which are needed for [DCSync](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/dump-password-hashes-from-domain-controller-with-dcsync).
![[PHS.webp]]
#### Pass Through Authentication
- Pass through authentication keeps the passwords on-premise but also allows the users to have a single password for Azure and on-premise. For example, when a user logins to Outlook on the web, they enter their credentials into the web portal (Entra ID), which Azure then uses PKI to encrypt the credentials and sends them to an agent on-premise. The agent decrypts the credentials and validates it against the DC, which returns a status back to the agent, which is then relayed back to Entra ID. It’s possible to perform DLL injection into the PTA agent and intercept authentication requests, which include credentials in clear-text.
![[PTA.webp]]
#### Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS)
- Entra ID can connect back to on-premise via ADFS. With ADFS, Entra ID is set as a trusted agent for federation and allows login with on-premise credentials.
![[ADFS.webp]]
## Azure REST APIs
- Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which provide create, retrieve, update, or delete access to the service's resources. Commonly used Rest API endpoints are listed below:
	- Azure Resource Manager: https://management.azure.com
	- Microsoft Graph: https://graph.microsoft.com
	- Azure AD Graph(Deprecated) : https://graph.windows.net
	- Key Vault: https://{keyvaultname}.vault.azure.net
## Azure Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication is a process of recognizing a user’s identity by validating the credentials.
- Authorization is the act where the authenticated user’s identity is granted permissions to access the resources/data.
- Microsoft Identity platform uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication & OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol works as a identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0. It helps in validating the user’s identity while trying to access the protected resources.
- OAuth (Open Authentication) is an open standard authorization protocol / framework designed for granting access to the resources. It enables the third party application to obtain limited access on the resources, either on behalf of the resource owner, or by obtaining the access on its own behalf. It also allows user’s account information to be shared with third party without exposing the user’s credentials. There are 4 primary actors involved in the flow:
	- Authorization Server
	- Resource Owner
	- OAuth Client
	- Resource Server
## Azure Tokens
- Data that carries information about the user’s identity that can facilitates the process of authentication and authorization. There are three type of Tokens:
	- ID Token: This token is issued by the authorization server. It contains basic information about the user. It allows the client to verify the user who they claim to be.
	- Access Token: The client presents this token while accessing the protected resource. It can be used only for a specific combination of user, client, and resource and cannot be revoked until expiry that is 1 hour by default.
	- Refresh Token: Provided to the client with access token. Used to get new refresh, access and ID tokens. It is bound to a specific combination of user and client and can be revoked. Default expiry is 90 days for inactive refresh tokens and no expiry for active tokens.
- Microsoft identity platform implements tokens in JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs tokens are split into 3 parts:
	- Header : It provides information about the type of token and how to validate the token and how the token was signed.
	- Payload : It contains all the important details about the users/app that will call the service.
	- Signature : It contains the raw material that is used to validate the token.
## Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Roles
- Azure offers a more granular control to security with RBAC, in the form of Roles. It differs from Policies by focusing on user actions at different scopes. You might be added to the Contributor role for a resource group, allowing you to make changes to that resource group. RBAC in Azure allows for custom roles, however many businesses rely on the built-in roles. The list of roles and their access can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-role-based-access-control).
- There’s a difference between Azure roles (referred to as Azure RBAC) and Entra ID roles. The primary difference, is that Entra ID roles only affect Entra ID and do not have any influence over resources within Azure. With this being said, the exclusion to that is the Global Administrator role, which has the option (literally a toggle switch in the Azure Portal) to also give themselves (Global Administrator) ownership of all resources within Azure itself.
- Within the Azure portal, you can read a resource’s security settings, such as which roles can access or make changes to that resource. This can be viewed in the Identity Access & Management (IAM) tab in the Azure portal if you prefer not to use the CLI.
- Resources can have their own specific access control list (ACL), so you can add a user to only be able to view that specific resource. It’s important to note that roles/permissions are inheritance-based, meaning if a user is in the Contributor role for the resource group, they will effectively have Contributor access to every resource within the resource group. Even if they are only assigned to the reader role for a resource within that resource group, since they have Contributor access to the whole group they will be a Contributor to that resource.
## Application Services in Azure and Entra ID

	- Connection Strings: This can be enumerated by reading the environment variables.
	- Application Code: This can be enumerated by reading the application source code.
	- Application Config Files: This can be enumerated by reading the application config files.
	- Tenant Information: This information can be extracted from the access token request by leveraging Managed Identity. MI should be enabled on the application.

#### Function Apps
- Function App (also called Azure Functions) is Azure's 'serverless' solution to run code. Languages like C#, Java, PowerShell, Python and more are supported. A Function App is supposed to be used to react to an event like:
	- HTTP Trigger
	- Run code on scheduled time
	- Respond to events such as Database changes and more
- App service provides the hosting infrastructure for function apps.
- Function apps support Managed Identities.
- Function apps are stateless except Durable Function apps.
- **Function App code is stored in File Share of the Storage account associated with the Function App.**
- There are 3 access level that can be defined in the function app for each endpoint:
	- Anonymous: Everyone is allowed to access the function in the Function App.
	- Function: Users with the specific function key is allowed to access the specific function in the Function App.
	- Host: Users can access all the functions In the Function App.
- Each Function App contains Master Key that allows administrative access to the Function App and REST APIs. We can leverage Master Key to **retrieve and modify** the source code of the Function App.
- The base URL is of the format `https://{functionappname}.azurewebsites.net/api/{funcname}`.
- There are multiple types of triggers that can invoke the function apps:
	- HTTP Trigger

## Key Vaults
- Key Vault is a azure service for centrally storing secrets like passwords, connection strings, certificates, private keys etc. It also simplifies administrations of application secrets and integrates with other Azure services.
- Object types available with a key vault:
	- Cryptographic Keys (RSA, EC etc.)
	- Secrets (Passwords, connection strings)
	- Certificates (Life cycle management)
	- Storage account keys (manage and rotate access keys for Storage Accounts)
- Objects in a key vault are identified using Object Identifier URL. The base URL is of the format: `https://{vaultname}.vault.azure.net/{object-type}/{object-name}/{object-version}`.
	- `{vaultname}` is the globally unique name of the key vault
	- `{object type`} can be "keys", "secrets" or "certificates“
	- `{object-name}` is unique name of the object within the key vault
	- `{object-version}` is system generated and optionally used to address a unique version of an object.
- Access to a vault is controlled though two planes:
	- Management plane: Manage the key vault operations like creating, deleting Key Vault. Only Azure role based access control (RBAC) is supported. Note: A role like Contributor that has permissions in the management plane to manage Access Policies can get access to the secrets by modifying the access policies.
	- Data plane: Manage the data and operations such add, delete and modify keys, secrets and certificates in the Key Vault. This supports Key Vault Access Policies or Azure RBAC.
- Key Vault supports 2 permission models which needs to be specified while creating the Key Vault.
	- Access Policy
	- Azure RBAC
## Azure Storage
- It is a Microsoft cloud storage solution used for data storage. The data is accessible from anywhere in the world via Rest API over HTTP or HTTPS. The Azure Storage platform includes the following data services:
	- [Azure Blobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction): A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
	- [Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction): Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
	- [Azure Elastic SAN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-introduction): A fully integrated solution that simplifies deploying, scaling, managing, and configuring a SAN in Azure.
	- [Azure Queues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction): A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
	- [Azure Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview): A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.

- There are multiple ways to control access to a storage account
	- Use Azure AD credentials: Authorize user, group or other identities based on Azure AD authentication. RBAC roles supported.
	- Connection String: Contains authorization information required by the application to access the data from the Storage Account at runtime using the Shared Key authorization. Connection Strings can be stored in the application config file like` web.config` , `app.config` etc. It can also be stored in the environment variable.
	- Shared Access Signature (SAS): Time limited and specific permissions. We can define:
		- What resource the client can access
		- Permission that the client has on those resources
		- Timeframe for which the SAS is valid
	- Shared Key (Account Name & Key): Use access keys of the storage account. This provides full access to the storage account (root password to the Storage Account).	
## Databases
- Azure offers multiple enterprise grade database service such as fully managed relational, NoSQL and in memory databases.
- Depending on the use the application developers can choose the database technology offered by Azure.
	- Cosmos DB: Low latency & high availability at scale (the database administration overhead of management, updates and patching is taken care by Azure Cosmos DB). There are multiple types of databases that are supported:
		- Core (SQL): It stores data in document format. Structured Query Language (SQL) can be used to interact the data.
		- Cassandra: It stores data in column oriented schema. Cassandra Query Language (CQL) can be used to interact with the data.
		- Mongo DB: It stores data in document structure by leveraging BSON format. Tools such as MongoDB shell, MongoDB Compass and Robo3t can be used to interact with the data.
		- Gremlin: I stores the data in edges and vertices. It leverage graph database algorithm based on Apache TinkerPop graph computing framework. Graph query language can be used to interact with the data.
		- Table: It stores the data in key/value format. It leverages Azure Table storage in background.
	- Azure SQL: Managed & Intelligent SQL in cloud
	- PostgreSQL: Scalable, secure & enterprise ready with high performance Database
	- MySQL / MariaDB: Open source, High availability, elastic scaling & managed community instance
